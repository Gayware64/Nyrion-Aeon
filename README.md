# Nyrion-Aeon
In an alternate timeline where terminals gained consciousness, Nyrion-Aeon emerged — not just as a shell, but as a philosophy engine. This Python-powered reimagining of Nyrion is packed with features, mysteries, and at least one internal interpreter that may or may not be dreaming of electric sheep.
