# Nyrion-Aeon

Nyrion Aeon is built for the diehardsâ€”the ones too stubborn to jump ship to LTA Atlas. If you're the kind of user who prefers a more raw, hands-on, and slightly chaotic experience, Aeon is your haven. It's a continuation of the Nyrion 1.0 legacy, built directly on top of LTAcore 0.4, with plenty of enhancements, tweaks, and of course, a healthy dose of attitude.

Rather than follow the more polished, standardized path of LTA Atlas, Aeon stays true to its roots: lightweight, expressive, and slightly unpredictable. Think of it as the "classic edition" of Nyrion with a bit of an edgeâ€”and it's proudly aware of that fact.

Each Aeon release comes with at least two months of official support, including critical bug fixes and updates. That said, these builds aren't meant to be foreverâ€”they're snapshots of a philosophy, and that philosophy moves fast. 

ðŸš¨ Important Support Notice:
The current mainline release, Aeon 1.0, will officially reach End of Support (EOS) on August 30th, 2025. If you're still running 1.0, now's the time to consider upgrading to the latest version to stay current and secure.

So, if you're not quite ready to conform to the Atlas ecosystem and still believe in the spirit of Nyrion 1.0, Aeon might be exactly what you're looking for.
