## What is Nyrion Aeon?

**Nyrion Aeon** is a bold, no-BS command-line shell built on [LTAcore 0.7](https://github.com/Gayware64/LTAcore). Crafted for power users who want uncompromising control, packed with 50+ commands, smart defaults, and a rebellious spirit.

This shell advances the legacy of Nyrion 1.0, adding powerful new utilities, persistent configuration, safe execution practices, and slick usability improvements. Fast-paced and raw â€” this isnâ€™t your average shell.
